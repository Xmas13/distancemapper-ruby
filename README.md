# distancemapper-ruby

Requirements: 

HTTParty

Google Maps API Key

This is a simple terminal based program to measure distances between two points using google maps. I found it an interesting project to work on and there is still more to do with it to make it better. 

Feel free to fork it or clone it and mess with it. It's not anything amazing..
